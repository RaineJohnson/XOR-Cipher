A XOR Cipher that takes 5 plain text inputs and encrypts it with 2 keys. After doing the XOR operation, the avalanche effect (how small a change in input results in a significant change in output) is calculated by iterating through each bit in the key and comparing the differing bits between the two binary strings.
